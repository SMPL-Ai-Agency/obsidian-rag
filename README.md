## Obsidian RAG
### A Customizable Obsidian Hybrid RAG Plugin for Obsidian Notes
Obsidian RAG is a fork of the MindMatrix Obsidian plugin. The difference is that it seamlessly synchronizes your notes with a **Supabase vector store** and **Neo4j graph database** to build a Hybrid RAG system for AI automation platforms and large language models (LLMs) like AI assistants.  

It prioritizes **Ollama-powered embeddings** (local or cloud-hosted) for privacy and cost efficiency, while also providing optional support for **OpenAI API** and compatible models.  
This enables efficient knowledge retrieval and automation across multiple vaults. Build custom integrations, automate workflows with **n8n**, and turn your Second Brain into a dynamic, searchable resource accessible via AI tools—without mixing content between projects.  

For example, create a **Telegram bot** that searches your vectorized notes and GraphRAG entities in Neo4j for answers. An **n8n workflow** can integrate Perplexity or other search APIs to blend your personal knowledge with external data, delivering a portable, intelligent assistant.

## Summary
Obsidian RAG connects your Obsidian vaults to both a Supabase vector store and a Neo4j graph database to create a **Hybrid RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system.

It pairs **semantic embeddings** (for context-aware retrieval) with **graph relationships** (for linked knowledge and entity mapping), allowing your notes to power intelligent assistants, automations, and advanced search tools—all while preserving project separation and privacy.

## Plugin Features
These are the built-in mechanisms and core behaviors the plugin executes to make the system work.

- **Automatic note synchronization:** Detects new, edited, and deleted notes; syncs them in near-real-time to **Supabase (vector)** and **Neo4j (graph)**.  
- **Embedding generation service:** Uses **Ollama by default** for vector embeddings, with optional **OpenAI or compatible models**.  
- **Graph construction engine:** Builds and updates Neo4j nodes & relationships for notes, tags, and entities—enabling GraphRAG-style semantic-graph queries.  
- **Queue and task management:** Orchestrates sync and embedding jobs with parallelization, retry logic, and event-based updates.  
- **Offline queue and reconciliation:** Stores unsent sync jobs locally and executes them automatically once connectivity resumes.  
- **Configurable exclusions:** Supports ignore rules for folders or files (e.g., templates, private journals, daily logs).  
- **Database setup automation:** Initializes Supabase tables, vector indexes, and Neo4j schema automatically on first run.  
- **Connection status and error handling:** Provides database connection indicators, graceful error recovery, and automatic retry cycles.  
- **Progress tracking and notifications:** Displays in-app progress indicators and user notifications for ongoing syncs, updates, and errors.  
- **Cross-device sync management:** Uses a unified sync-state file to coordinate edits and deletions between multiple devices.  
- **Extensible architecture:** Written in modular TypeScript services (`EmbeddingService`, `QueueService`, `SupabaseService`, etc.) for developer extension.  
- **n8n workflow hooks:** Exposes triggers and endpoints so **n8n** can invoke sync, query, and embedding operations programmatically.  
- **Developer utilities:** Includes helper scripts for database queries, resets, and automated release management.

## Use Cases
Once the plugin is configured and running, users can perform these tasks and automations:

- **Sync multiple vaults safely:** Keep “Research,” “Business,” and “Personal” vaults independent while syncing each to Supabase and Neo4j—no cross-project data mixing.  
- **Semantic search and retrieval:** Ask natural-language questions or find related ideas using meaning-based search powered by **Ollama** (local or cloud), with optional **OpenAI-compatible** APIs.  
- **Graph-based knowledge exploration:** Visualize and navigate relationships between notes, tags, people, and topics in **Neo4j** for connected thinking, genealogy, and research analysis.  
- **Automated workflows with n8n:** Automate sync, semantic, and graph-based queries—or hybrid (RAG + GraphRAG) searches—and deliver results to **Telegram**, **Discord**, dashboards, or other AI automation platforms.  
- **Build custom AI assistants:** Combine your private knowledge base with external data (e.g., **Perplexity**, search APIs) to create intelligent chatbots and agent systems powered by your notes and graph entities.  
- **Local-first privacy mode:** Run embeddings and databases entirely on your local machine for full data control, offline operation, and zero external dependency.  
- **Cross-device synchronization:** Keep notes, deletions, and metadata consistent across devices via a shared **sync state file** that maintains vault integrity.  
- **Offline operation:** Continue capturing and editing notes offline—updates are queued locally and automatically reconciled once you reconnect.
