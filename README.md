## Obsidian RAG
### Hybrid RAG Sync for Obsidian Notes
Obsidian RAG is a fork of the MindMatrix Obsidian plugin. It seamlessly synchronizes your notes with a Supabase vector store and Neo4j graph database to build a Hybrid RAG system for AI automation platforms and large language models (LLMs) like AI assistants.
It prioritizes Ollama-powered embeddings (local or cloud-hosted) for privacy and cost efficiency, while also providing support for OpenAI API and compatible models. This enables efficient knowledge retrieval and automation across multiple vaults. Build custom integrations, automate workflows with n8n, and turn your Second Brain into a dynamic, searchable resource accessible via AI tools—without mixing content between projects.
For example, create a Telegram bot for on-the-go queries that searches your vectorized notes and GraphRAG entities in Neo4j for answers. An n8n workflow can integrate Perplexity or other search APIs to blend personal knowledge with external data, delivering a portable, intelligent assistant.

## Overview
Obsidian RAG syncs your notes to a Supabase vector store and Neo4j graph database, enabling a Hybrid RAG system for AI assistants and automation:
- Build workflows with n8n to upsert multi-vault data without mixing projects.
- Create semantic and graph-based searches for your Second Brain knowledge, prioritizing Ollama embeddings (local or cloud) over OpenAI API, with support for OpenAI and compatibles.
- Develop integrations via PostgreSQL/Neo4j connections, like Telegram bots or Perplexity-augmented queries.

---

## Features
- Automatic synchronization of new and modified notes.
- Real-time updates as notes are added or edited.
- Configurable exclusion rules for files and directories.
- Generation of vector embeddings for semantic similarity search.
- Robust offline support with an operation queue and reconciliation.
- Cross-device coordination via a dedicated sync file.

## Project Status
### Completed ✅
- Core database setup and configuration
- Development environment setup
- Basic plugin functionality
- File synchronization system
- Initial user interface
- Database Connection and Setup Automation
    - Automatic database connection testing
    - Connection status indicators
    - Table setup automation
    - Database reset functionality
    - Comprehensive error handling
- Core Services Implementation
    - SupabaseService with connection handling
    - EmbeddingService with embeddings
    - QueueService with task processing
    - SyncManager with file management
    - EventEmitter system
    - StatusManager with progress tracking
    - SyncDetectionManager
    - InitialSyncManager with batch processing

### In Progress 🚧
- Documentation updates
- MindMatrix codebase Bug review and fixes
- Fix the Supabase deletion ID mismatch so data integrity is restored for delete tasks.
- Prevent double registration of vault events to stop duplicate task processing and side effects.
- Repair `TextSplitter` construction so chunking respects user settings and metadata extraction has the right dependencies.
- Stabilize `removeExcludedFiles` filter assembly so database cleanup for exclusions succeeds reliably.
- MindMatrix Performance optimizations
- Additional testing and validation

### Upcoming 📅
- Advanced search features in both RAG and GraphRAG Databases
- Additional file type support
- Developer tools and debugging features
- Community features and collaboration tools
