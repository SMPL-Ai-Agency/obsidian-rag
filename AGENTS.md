# AGENTS

## Scope
This file applies to the entire repository unless a nested `AGENTS.md` overrides it.

## Conventions
- Follow the existing coding style of surrounding files instead of introducing new patterns.
- Keep changes focused and add explanatory comments when introducing non-obvious logic.
- Prefer `yarn` for installing dependencies and running scripts.

## Testing
- Run the most relevant `yarn` scripts (e.g., `yarn test`, `yarn lint`, `yarn build`) for the area you touched before opening a PR.
- Include the commands you ran in your final summary, noting whether they passed.

## Pull Request Notes
- Summaries should list the most important code or documentation changes.
- Mention any limitations or follow-up work if tests cannot be run locally.
