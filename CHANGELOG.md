## [Unreleased]

### Added
- _TBD_

### Changed
- _TBD_

## [1.1.0-beta] - 2025-11-13

### Added
- Entity preview overlay inside the NotificationManager so advanced entity syncs can be validated without leaving Obsidian.
- Local embedding cache in `EmbeddingService` that stores Ollama/OpenAI responses in browser storage to avoid redundant API calls.
- Batched entity helpers in `Neo4jService` with shared `runWrite` error-wrapping to simplify future GraphRAG upserts.
- Embedding cache TTL controls in the settings tab so each vault can tune how long vectors are reused before regeneration.
- Status-bar entity overlay actions that open the originating note directly from the preview.
- Configurable Neo4j batch size slider plus server-side chunking safeguards so giant entity or chunk payloads do not overwhelm Aura/Neo4j instances.
- Hybrid-mode integration test that validates entity extraction + embedding cache hits, ensuring end-to-end coverage for the ingestion pipeline.
- `sql/migrations/` directory with the first idempotent migration and documentation describing how to evolve Supabase schemas safely.
- TypeDoc configuration and `yarn docs` helper for generating API documentation straight from the TypeScript sources.
- Release checklist (see `release/RELEASE_ARTIFACTS.md`) outlining manifest bumps, build steps, and tagging requirements ahead of GitHub releases.
- Example n8n workflow scaffolding to jumpstart cache export automations.

### Changed
- Updated README.md and INSTALL.md to clarify the ingestion-only workflow, document the available command palette controls, and replace broken documentation links.
- Filtered GraphBuilder relationship parsing to drop low-confidence edges and improved Jest coverage around malformed LLM responses.
- Pinned `ts-jest` to `29.2.5` to prevent future regressions from tooling churn.
- NotificationManager now receives the Obsidian `App` reference so it can open notes safely without relying on global helpers.
- Neo4j upserts now respect server-friendly batch limits (default 500) and the new Jest suite enforces that limit going forward.

## [1.1.0-alpha] - 2025-11-13

### Added
- Neo4j graph sync integration with configurable `project_name` isolation plus a Hybrid mode that writes to Supabase and Neo4j in lockstep.

### Changed
